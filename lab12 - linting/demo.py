# Linting - Checking and evaluating code to ensure it follows best practice
# Global best practice

# Bad practice:
def helloWorld():
   return "Hello" # 3 spaces of indentation

def secondFunction():
          return "7 spaces"


# Industry best practice - Conventions followed by company / organisation
# under_score_case_is_best - Company style guides
car_colour = "red"

# Linting fixes global best practice issues as it has a 'database' of what 'good code looks like'
